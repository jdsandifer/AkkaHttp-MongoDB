# Akka HTTP Quickstart with MondoDB

This is a repo I created to provide a simple setup for a basic REST API
using Scala, Akka HTTP, and MongoDB.

It also includes a setup for route testing.
(Testing the API from input to output without using HTTP connections.)

Note: Mongo is setup to read from a local database.
You'll have to point it to the right spot for your project.
